Syntax
------------


<variables>: these represent nodes in the causal diagram. There are special variables, denoted E and O (exposure and outcome). 
~: represent a causal relationship. The LHS is a child variable of all the variables on the RHS.
+: assumes a linear relationship between variables
<floats>: can be added or multiplied to variables
*: multiply a coefficient by a variable.

Ex:
```
R ~ X1 + X2 + X3;
Z ~ X4;
Z ~ X2;
Z ~ X4 + X5; // X4 will only be added once
E ~ Z + R + 1.0;
Y ~ 5.0*E + Z;
```


Future:
Introduce non-linear relationships
Introduce different noise
